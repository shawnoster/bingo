# Bingo.Answers

## About

Bingo.Answers is a REST/Web API that works with bingo _Answers_. An _Answer_ is a condition that needs to be met in order to mark a bingo square. _Answers_ are grouped by category. In a standard game of bingo, the bingo square "B1" would have a `condition` of `"1"` and a `category` of `"B"`.

See the [Bingo (American version) Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version)) for details on the game of bingo.
